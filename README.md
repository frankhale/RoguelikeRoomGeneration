# RoguelikeRoomGeneration

Working on algorithms to generate rooms for a roguelike game

- ProceduralLevelGeneration is a .NET 5 console project that just generates
  random rooms on a map. The rooms are not connected yet. This project only
  exists to work on the algorithm. This will be done when rooms can be
  connected.
